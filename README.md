## Description

Repo for CareLink Windows App
This is a Visual Basic application that provides a UI to view Medtronic 670G and 770G (possibly 780G but that has not been tested).
This shows (almost) all available data and is not in any way supported by Medtronic, it was created from publicly available data.
Some data was filtered out because I could not see any use for it. You can turn off filters but performance will suffer.

Try it out and send feedback.
I plan on doing a better UI similar to what is provided on mobile phones with added functionality
